
HTTP2 is multiplexed. HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

HTTP2 achieves faster webpage loading without performance optimizations that require extensive development efforts.

HTTP2 is a binary protocol. So much more compressed than HTTP1.1
