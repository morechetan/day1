Objects are different than primitive datatypes(number, string, boolean, etc.)
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of " Key : value " pair. 

Example 1:

const school = {
name : "DAV School",
location : "Muzaffarpur"
}

Here, "name" and "location" are all "keys" and "DAV School" and "Muzaffarpur" are values of these keys respectively. Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object. 

Example 2:

const school = {}
school.name = "DAV School"
school.location = "Muzaffarpur"

Here, first we have created empty object and then added 2 properties.

Example 3:

const school = new Object()
school.name = "DAV School"
school.location = "Muzaffarpur"

Here, first we have created new JavaScript object using "new" keyword and then added 2 properties.
